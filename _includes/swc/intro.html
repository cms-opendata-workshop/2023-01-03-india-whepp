  Since 2014, the CMS Collaboration has pioneered the release of LHC research quality data for public
  use by making a significant amount of these data accessible through the CERN Open Data portal.  
  At the end of 2021, the CMS Collaboration released the first batch of its Run 2 data.
  This workshop aims to bridge the 
  technical gap that usually exists between the scientific creativity of an external 
  analyst and the nuts-and-bolts details of a full analysis with CMS open data.
  All exercises will be hands-on and participants should be prepared to dive into 
  the data right away. Participants will begin by completing software setup exercises, and then 
  the final four days of the workshop will focus on learning how to perform research-level analysis with CMS Open Data.
