## Welcome

Welcome to WHEPP 2024 sessions  on the use of open data from the CMS experiment. We are really happy to have you here!

Please subscribe to our [mattermost team](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/signup_user_complete/?id=dbcwsbngd3fnxp4n8ry8aa5hpc&md=link&sbr=su), where dedicated discussion channels will be created to assist you during the lessons.  
To join the team:
- Click on the invite link above
- Select "Log in with CERN single sign-on" **even if you do not have CERN credentials!** They are not required for this team.
- Select a login option. Those with CERN credentials can use the CERN login, and those without can choose a login option from the righthand column -- perhaps an email address or Google account.
- After completing the login step, your web browser should point you to the "Town Square" channel
- The specific channels described below can be joined by clicking on those links, or by selecting "Add channels --> Browse channels" from the left-side menu.

## Pre-exercises

During the first 3 days of our workshop sessions (Jan 3-5, 2024) you will work through a series of "pre-exercises" to set up the infrastructure required for doing research with open data and for the following lessons. 
This work will be primarily self-paced, and the local facilitators will be available to help with technical issues. 
Additional assistance will be available via the [Pre-exercises Help mattermost channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsodwswhepp24/channels/pre-exercises-help).

## Lessons and Activities

We will gather for large-group lessons and hands-on Open Data activities on Jan 6-7 and 9-10, 2024. Discussion and technical queries concerning these lessons will take place on the [Lessons & Activities mattermost channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsodwswhepp24/channels/lessons--activities).
The CMS Open Data team members will present from [Zoom](https://cern.zoom.us/j/95212002203?pwd=VmYzQjhpWWpQVHdSUzliVnRjZlVaQT09), and the local facilitators will be present for in-person help.

<!--## Workshop strategy

During the workshop you will be introduced to examples on how to access physical objects, like electrons, muons and jets, and their properties.  For this, a basic understanding of `ROOT` and `CMSSW` is needed.  Legacy releases of these frameworks are most efficiently preserved using containers, like `Docker`.  You will also learn about triggers and how to determine the luminosity for an analysis, which will complete the basics about extracting the needed information from our open data.  After this a brief analysis example, using pre-processed Run 1 data, will be presented.

At the heart of this workshop, we will attempt to run a simplified, but quite thorough, physics analysis.  We will do this using pre-processed Run 2 data. Then, you will have the opportunity to learn about cloud computing and why its usage is advantageous for performing analysis with open data.  Finally, an alternative way of doing analysis, with ADL (Analysis Description Language), will be presented.
